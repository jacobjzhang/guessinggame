Lessons Learned:

- Keep variables global if you want to reference them after a function has ran (we wanted to keep randnum, guessednum, and difference)

- When replacing a jQuery element, make sure the replacement has the same identifier so you could replace it again.

- Don't return anything unless you want to end the function (??)
